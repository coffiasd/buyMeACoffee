## why us
Inspired by [buymeacoffee](https://buymeacoffee.com/) website.
In the field of Web3, there are many excellent content creators who daily produce a wealth of crypto-related content on social media. I believe we need a platform to help these creators receive crypto tips. This platform should be decentralized, where anyone can create a custom tipping link. You can share this link on your social media or anywhere else. Every tip received by users can be tracked on-chain, ensuring transparency.
